aaa-jsoncrud-interface
============

A Polymer element that provides a simple ajax json message passing interface to a backend server to perform CRUD operations. 
An emulation facility is provided so that no backend is required. 

A sample PHP mysql backend is provided (in addition to emulation) -- to use this you will require a PHP mysql environemnt,
you will need to create the target table and modify the connection statement. Please see comments in UserCRUD.php 

ps I have not included the php program just yet -- should follow shortly

```
