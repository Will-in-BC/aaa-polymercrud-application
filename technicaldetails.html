      <h1>Technical Details</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> Welcome to the Polymer CRUD sample application. It is a project of Will Hopkins of 
          <a href='http://www.aureusarcus.com'>Aureus Arcus Advising Ltd</a> 
          and was developed, in part, as a learning exercise as well as a means of demonstrating some of the power of 
          web components and Polymer. 
          <a href='https://www.polymer-project.org/'> Polymer</a> itself is a Google project to enable and enhance web components. 
      </p>
      <p> Many, many web applications require a way of maintaining data base records on a server. In fact after writing a "Hello World" 
          application next on the list of prototypical applications is one to create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) database records.
          I wanted to learn Polymer and I also wanted to provide an application that deals with some of
          the nuances of a multi-user environment. The sample PHP mysql back-end is transaction processing aware ensuring 
          records are read for update, checked for currency, and only then updated or deleted. 
          The front end application needs to be sensitive to any concurrency conflicts. 
      </p>
      <p> I also wanted to provide a good reference application. I've seen many post to Stack Overflow and the like asking for 
          further examples on how to use Polymer. Polymer and web components are very powerful tools. 
          I hope by providing a full, sample application I'll help others along the way.  
      <h2>Custom Elements and Where to Get Them</h2>
      <p>
          The application makes use of the following custom elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href='https://github.com/Will-in-BC/aaa-form-layout.git'>aaa-form-layout</a> 
          -- generates a form and provides a means for interacting with the form. The form may be generated 
          from an external file (formitems.json) which makes the element highly reusable
        </li>
        <li> <a href='https://github.com/Will-in-BC/aaa-form-controls.git'>aaa-form-controls</a> 
          -- generates a set of CRUD controls for a form
        </li>
        <li> <a href='https://github.com/Will-in-BC/aaa-settings-dialog.git'>aaa-settings-dialog</a> 
          -- generates a modal settings dialog and a means to retrieve settings values. The dialog may be generated 
            from an external file (settingitems.json) which makes the element highly reusable. 
        </li>
        <li> <a href='https://github.com/Will-in-BC/aaa-jsoncrud-interface.git'>aaa-jsoncrud-interface</a> 
          -- provides an interface supporting CRUD actions through the passing of simple json messages.
            The interface will also emulate the server so applications can be demonstrated without the need for a database back-end.
        </li>    
        <li> <a href='https://github.com/Will-in-BC/aaa-simple-content.git'>aaa-simple-content</a> 
          -- gives a quick way of inserting content acquired through a link import tag. Used for including text such as the instructions and 
            technical details. 
        </li>    
        <li> <a href='https://github.com/Will-in-BC/aaa-animatedlogo-dialog.git'>aaa-animatedlogo-dialog</a> 
          -- this was just for fun -- an animated Aureus Arcus Advising logo. 
        </li>    
      </ul>
      <p>
        Links to GitHub are included in the above list. Each element has its own independent demo so you can get a good sense of usage. 
        You can either use the zip files or bower to install. The repository for the application itself is
